=======================

SVN::Notify::HTML::Outlook - for formatting svnnotify messages to display well in Outlook

The package is a add-on for [SVN::Notify](https://github.com/theory/svn-notify).

The package was inspired by a message left here:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=30014

The package outputs HTML that will not cause the metadata table to take up 6 lines in Outlook.

It is a subclass of SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff.
